The DLA model simulates growth via diffusion, selecting growth sites based on concentration. A Monte Carlo version uses random walkers that stick upon contact. The Gray-Scott model simulates reaction-diffusion of chemicals U and V, forming patterns based on reaction rates. Different parameters influence growth shapes and dynamics in both models.
